  summary: >
    I’m fascinated by the efficiency of using computational technics to 
    numerically simulate or predict materials’ properties. Also, I really 
    enjoy implementing or developing new algorithms to break through restrictions 
    that are ubiquitous in the computational physics’ field. My passion for this subject 
    has led me to pursue further studies and ultimately, a career in computational physics.

      Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art python package for predicting the most likely structure of organic interfaces.
    highlights:
      - "Designed a graph-theory algorithm for efficient slab generation, which outperformed all previous algorithms in 
        conserving the atom numbers and structures as well as mechanical properties"
      - "Implemented a lattice matching algorithm for optimizing the lattice parameters of new interfaces and the coordinates of every atom"
      - "Created a Graphic Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting organic systems‘ non-bonded interactions, with the efficiency of empirical methods and the accuracy of DFT method"
      - "Used three different workflows to optimize the structure of interfaces, and GNN exceeded others in accuracy and time cost (Errors < 3%, 10000 × faster than DFT)"
