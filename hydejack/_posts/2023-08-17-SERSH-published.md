title: New paper <em>"Nonempirical Range-Separated Hybrid Functional with Spatially Dependent Screened Exchange"</em> is published on J. Chem. Theory Comput.
---

We are pleased to announce the publication of our paper on *SE-RSH* in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (JCTC). *SE-RSH* is a novel exchange-correlation (xc) functional designed for use in density functional theory (DFT). Our proposed functional aims to offer uniformly accurate descriptions for diverse components within complex heterogeneous materials. Notably, *SE-RSH* demonstrates its prowess by precisely predicting the electronic structures of various non-metallic interfaces, encompassing both three-dimensional and two-dimensional systems, as well as pristine and defective solids and nanoparticles.
