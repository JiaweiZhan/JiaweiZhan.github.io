title: New paper <em>"Ogre:&nbsp;A Python package for molecular crystal surface generation with applications 
    to surface energy and crystal habit prediction"</em> is published and selected as JCP Emerging Investigators Special Collection
---

Iâ€™m very glad to announce that our paper *Ogre* is published online and selected to become a part of JCP Emerging Investigators Special Collection. 
This paper partially represent the efforts we have made on surface generatons.
We want to write a tool to cleave slabs and predict the optimized
structure of interfaces. And this paper contains the first step. In this paper, we present Ogre, 
an open-source code for generating molecular crystal surface slabs based on
graphic molecular representations. Moreover, we utilize Ogre to carry out
quantum-chemistry calculation and crystal habit prediction.

In the subsequent research, we will use Ogre to cleave slabs and predict
optimized interfaces of two slabs via Monte-Carlo Methods and machine learning.
