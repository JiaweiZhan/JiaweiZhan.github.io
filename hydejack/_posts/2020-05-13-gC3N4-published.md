title: Our new paper <em>"Potassium-Doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> Achieving Efficient
    Visible-Light-Driven CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction"</em> is published on ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng.
---

I'm very happy to anounce that our paper is finally published after one year of
theoretical computations and experiments. In this paper, we report a new study on 
the potassium-doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (K-CN) being used for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction irradiated by visible light. 
And Our work further validates the importance of inhibiting e<sup>–</sup>/h<sup>+</sup> recombination 
in improving solar energy conversion efficiency while also bringing hope for efficient solar fuel production using g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.
