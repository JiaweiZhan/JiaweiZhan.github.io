caption: Expand the scale of systems that Hefei-Non-adiabatic Molecular Dynamics (HEFEI-NAMD) could analyze with the help of Berkeley GW.
description: >
    Ab initio GW calculation by VASP would take lots of computational cost,
    which further limits the number of atoms that the simulated cluster could
    contain. Therefore, in order to expand the scale of systems that Hefei-NAMD
    could analyze, we want to replace VASP GW with Berkeley GW, which is very
    famous for its large scale parallel algorithm and fast GW calculation.

[Hefei-NAMD](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zhaojin/code.html) is an ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics program to 
investigate the ultrafast excited carrier dynamics in real and momentum space, 
energy and time scale. Hefei-NAMD would take the screened coulomb interaction
W<sub>GG'</sub> and the difference of DFT_gap and GW_gap as input, construct
Betheâ€“Salpeter equation and finally carry out time dependent evolution.
Nowadays, there are mainly two version of Hefei-NAMD:  
- hefei-NAMD, developed by [Dr. Qijing Zhang](https://github.com/QijingZheng),
    is wroten in Fortran
- paraNAMD, developed by [Xiang Jiang](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~jxiang/), supports parallel computing and is wroten in C++. **(This project is based on paraNAMD)**

Previously, Hefei-NAMD obtain required quasiparticles information and screened
coulomb interaction frm [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), which is a widely used quantum-chemistry calculation
package based on Density Funtional Theory (DFT). VASP carries out a
full-frequency GW calculation to obtain the quasiparticles' bandstructure,
which is very accurate but more time-consuming.

[Berkeley GW](https://berkeleygw.org/), however, is very famous for its large-scale parallel algorithm. 
The package can be used to compute the electronic and optical properties of a 
wide variety of material systems from bulk semiconductors and metals to 
nanostructured materials and molecules. The package scales to 10,000's of CPUs 
and can be used to study systems containing up to 100's of atoms.

Therefore, this project would combine VASP and Berkeley GW, harvest each advantages
, accelerate GW calculation required by Hefei-NAMD and finally makes Hefei-NAMD
more applicable in excited carrier molecular dynamics simulation.
