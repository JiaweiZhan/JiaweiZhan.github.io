abstract: Recently, we introduced the screened-exchange range-separated hybrid (SE-RSH) functional to account for spatially dependent dielectric screening in complex materials. The SE-RSH functional has shown good performance in predicting the electronic properties of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators, and of heterogeneous systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric mismatch. Here, we assess the performance of SE-RSH for oxide materials, including antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides. Through a comparison with other dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, we demonstrate that SE-RSH yields improved predictions of dielectric constants and band gaps, bringing them into a closer agreement with experimental values. The functional also provides accurate values of magnetic moments of several oxides.
