abstract: Using a combination of first principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) and electronic structure calculations, we characterize the atomistic structure and vibrational properties of a photocatalytic surface of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a promising photoelectrode for the production of hydrogen peroxide. We then investigate the surface in contact with water and show that the electronic states of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are appropriately positioned in energy to facilitate the two-electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) over the competing four-electron oxygen evolution reaction. We further propose that the use of strained thin films interfaced with water is beneficial in decreasing the optical gap of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and thus utilizing a wider portion of the solar spectrum for the WOR.
