As a student majoring in Condensed Physics with an interest in computational physics, the experience of taking PH.D.training in the U.S. universities means a lot to me for my further education in this field. That novel experience might offer me the opportunity to make acquaintance with lots of well-rounded reseachers and prestigious professors and frequent face-to-face communication. What’s more, it would naturally drive me to think about whether physics is the very field that I want to devote 100 percent of my time and attention in. In addition, perfect research environment is another factor that exerts a peculiar fascination on me since working in a top-class lab with thought-provoking professors and open-minded teammates is absolutely an enjoyable thing. Also, the beautiful campus scenery and intelligent students in U.S. universities do impress me a lot. During my last summer session, I attended the summer school in UCLA and took credit classes there. Everyday wonderful sunshine puts me into a good mood with temperature favorable. In addition, my instructor there was very nice and would patiently explain every point I was caught in during the learning. And he even enjoyed sharing us with his own experience of painstaking but fruitful academic research.

However, persevering in doing research or not is always a challenging decision. To be candid, I have hesitated long ever since I decided to major in physics at the beginning. After agitating confusion and a series of trials, luckily, it dawned on me that making contributions to the theories for some applicable uses does strike me as gratification. The consequence is that I am addicted to the charm of physics. And now, my goal is clearer than ever before both short-term and long-term. During my undergraduate life, I want  to assist my teammates to establish the theoretical foundation of one biomaterial which could simultaneously detect and deal with cancer cell in therapy and put it into effect.  Also, I want to analyze the properties of multiple molecules systems with the help of VASP. After graduation, I’m determined to go abroad for more advanced expertise in order to satisfy my curiosity in the physical field. And then, if everything follows my schedule, I, with no hesitation, would  chase the academic path in one of the top universities to continue my research.

Interest Ph.D. Programs: Physics, Statistics, Computer Science.
