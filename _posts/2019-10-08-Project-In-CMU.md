Project: A Python Package for Lattice and Surface Matching of Epitaxial Interfaces: Organic Interfaces <br/>
Advisor: Dr. Noa Marom (Jul. 2019 – Sep. 2019)<br/>
Summary: Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art python package for predicting the most likely structure of organic interfaces.
-	Designed a graph-theory algorithm for efficient slab generation, which outperformed all previous algorithms in conserving the atom numbers and structures as well as mechanical properties 
-	Implemented a lattice matching algorithm for optimizing the lattice parameters of new interfaces and the coordinates of every atom
-	Created a Graphic Neural Network (GNN) model for predicting organic systems‘ non-bonded interactions, with the efficiency of empirical methods and the accuracy of DFT method
-	Used three different workflows to optimize the structure of interfaces, and GNN exceeded others in accuracy and time cost (Errors < 3%, 10000 × faster than DFT)
